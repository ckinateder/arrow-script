Oh, Ollie, I kind of have this pseudo friend that's looking for a job. I was wondering if the club's still hiring? Yes. Of course. Talk to Tommy. As a matter of fact, you can go upstairs and call Tommy, right now. Great. You rock. Where you been? Um... Barcelona. Monaco, Budapest. I just needed to forget who I was. And how much I missed you. Do you mean like you missed Gus Sabatoni? I thought you were done with your father's organization, Helena. Because he's serving consecutive life sentences in Iron Heights prison. You got your revenge. He just cut a deal with the Justice Department to testify against the East Coast family. In 48 hours, Witness Protection will give him a new name, a new life, and he'll be off the grid forever-- untraceable! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My father doesn't deserve a second chance-- a second life. And I can't. I can't take on a phalanx of U.S. marshals. Not without help. No. It's m*rder. It's not justice. Oh, there you are. I have a question about your opening tonight. Hello. Hi. Oliver, who's your friend? Oh! Mom, this is Helena. Helena, this is my mother. Hi. Nice to meet you. Helena was just leaving. Yes. I have a family engagement. Excuse us for a minute. Of course. I guess I will just have to be more persuasive. Fortunately... You have a family, too. She was in my house. She made a not so veiled thr*at. I want extra security around my mother and sister. Way ahead of you, man. Thank you. It's my job. For not saying, \"I told you so.\" Night's young. Where you been? The club opens in four hours. I've been dealing with the vendors. No, you haven't. Tommy... We need to talk. I'm sorry, all right. But I kept this a secret to protect the people that are closest to me. Do you think that's what I care about? What, that my feelings are hurt? You're a m*rder*r. A k*ller. You were my best friend in life, but now it's like I don't even know you. You're right. I've changed. Listen, buddy, now I can explain to you. I can explain to you how and why-- What'd be the point? I wouldn't believe a word of it, anyway. One of those missiles has an effective range of up to 2,400 kilometers. We're not going anywhere until we figure out what Fyers is planning. Wild guess? He's planning on blowing something up. Well, one of those could do the job. But this? This is about starting a w*r. With who? What does it matter? We have to stop Fyers before he kills thousands of innocent people. There are tons of soldiers down there. Even if we get through all of them, we can't just steal a whole m*ssile launcher. Well, who said anything about stealing it? So what's the plan? Ambush? It's impossible. We can't take out all six without one radioing for back up. It'd be good if we could get all the soldiers in one place. You're right. What'd the stapler ever do to you? What is it, Laurel? I'm busy. The Hood's girlfriend is back. Dad, I'm sorry about this morning. But if I told you the real reason to come see me, you wouldn't have shown up. You're damn right I wouldn't.

I'll pass. She's not anyone's...property. Laurel makes her own decisions. And she chose you. Until you couldn't handle it. Lord knows I am guilty of a lot of things between us, but not you and her. That's all I came to say. What exactly do you do here? I work closely with my father. Guys, you got trouble. What?! Felicity's about to have some head of schedule company. I'm not there yet on the download. Hold tight, I'm on my way. Oliver. Mr. Merlyn. I must say, I'm surprised to see you here. Tommy and I just had a little unfinished business. Ahh.

And as we've already seen, they're not the friendliest bunch. So... It kind of looks like you've done that before. Back in Xingjian, I was pre-med. She's a woman of many talents. Come on. \"Come on\" where? To higher ground. We need to get to a vantage point where we can establish the enemy's position. What about Shado? I'll be fine here. We shouldn't split up. Let her play with her corpse. We'll be back before she knows it. Here you go, Bud. On the house, Officer Lance. Hey, no, no, no, here you go, a dog this delicious? I'd have to book myself for robbery. Take it. All right. Take care."

Starling City used to have its own aldicarb plant, but per the EPA, it was shut down three years ago. What's it being used for now? Nothing. It's abandoned.

This event, Mr. Blood, you might as well be painting a giant bulls eye on your chest. This city needs to come together. And I need to show them how. You won't be able to show them anything if you're dead. Every night, you risk your life for the people of this city. How can you expect me to do any less? And what about the lives of the people coming to your rally? This rally is about Starling City standing up and declaring with one voice that living afraid isn't living. I won't send a contrary message to people telling them to stay home, to stay scared. I've made my decision. That's the thing, alderman... whatever happens tomorrow night, it's not up to you. \u266a I wake up and she's not there \u266a Ah, Mrs. Fazekas. The train set for your nephew just came in. He's going to love it. Oh. You are a miracle worker, Mr. Scheffer. How much do I owe you? $50 even. Forget the sales tax. Going to the alderman's unity rally tomorrow night? I wouldn't miss it. Gathered here despite the rash of bombings that have plagued the city, some have called Sebastian Blood's unity rally a cynical and dangerous PR stunt for his mayoral campaign. But the crowd continues to grow. Tried to get him to stand down. He seems as stubborn as you when it comes to fighting back. Or everything. Hey, is this how it's going to be with you two from now on? Maybe we should just head down to the rally. Maybe we won't have to. I analyzed the b*mb remnants we got from Lance. The design's identical to the bombs used by an anti government militia group called the Movement. Lucky for us, they have a very active and hackable message board. One of their most prolific fans has an IP address right here in Starling. Tell me. The computer's in a local souvenir shop. The whackadoo in question goes by the username Shrapnel. You want back-up? No, I need you at the rally. Cover our bases. Is this all for me? No, for me. SCPD phone records. Why are you going through the department's phone records? Um, so I checked up on your not exactly boyfriend. And? Did you find anything? Yeah, it turns out he's a hell of a guy. Covers the expenses of his dear aunt... your Maya Resik. If Sebastian has other family, then why was he placed in an orphanage? Well, maybe 'cause Aunt Maya is nuttier than a Snickers bar. She's a patient at St. Walker's Hospital. It's a mental institution, it's the kind you don't check out of. Now, listen, you going to tell me what this is all about? Something about him just seems off. Laurel, there is nothing sinister about a guy who is covering the expenses of his only living relative. The truth is, it's kind of nice. Listen, I gotta get to City Plaza. Pike wants all hands at this unity rally. You're not going, right? No, I need to look into this more. Laurel, he seems like a good guy and you deserve good. Ok, so stop looking for reasons to talk yourself out of it. Please. Alderman Blood, is this not dangerous? I'm afraid so. Why are you gathering all these people here to be targets? Please, I'll get to all of your questions later.  Well, maybe he's dreaming about you. You know, actually there's conflicting cases about whether coma patients can in fact dream normally or they're more like hallucinating. Thank you."

I had a three day weekend, so I figured I'd drive down and surprise everybody. Well, you're just in time to eat. Come here. Get yourself another plate. Come on. Here you go.  Nyssa, don't do this. I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen. I thought it would be instructive for you to know what it feels like to suddenly lose someone you love. To have them ripped from your life without warning. You do not want to hurt my mother. You're right. I don't. You have one day, Ta-er al-Sahfer, Make the right choice. We have 24 hours. Detective... We'll find her. Ok, Laurel's inside, she's losing her mind, I got to go. Keep me updated. Oh, come on! You ought to buy a ticket if you're going to play like that! Hey, kiddo. How's the apartment hunt going? Terribly. I really wanted to find the perfect place to show Ollie when he gets back from his boat trip. Everything good was already taken by the time I walked in the door. Maybe it's a sign that you're not supposed to move in with the frat boy that you call a boyfriend. You and mom were my age when you moved into that place on Spring Street. You weren't even engaged yet. Well, that's 'cause your mother kept turning down all my proposals. She did? Oh, you know your mother, free spirit and all. Why do we need rings when we have love? You know I spent a year with that damn ring burning a hole in my pocket?"

Do we have a lead on Dinah? We researched the poison Nyssa used on Laurel. Luckily for us, Tibetan pit viper venom is surprisingly difficult to transport. It starts losing its potency the moment it leaves the fangs. Yet another sentence I never thought I'd actually say out loud. So it was bought locally? Not bought. Stolen. From where? The zoo. A local break-in. The perps didn't steal anything, so the cops chalked it up to a bunch of kids looking for a thrill. I pulled up the zoo CCTV footage from the night of the break-in. I caught a plate. The car's a rental. Address is in the Glades. Sara. Call your father.  Sebastian, I am so sorry. I have a bad habit of standing you up.

Then he shows up... at my mother's house. So he wants a fight, fine. I'll give him a fight. And this time, when I k*ll him, I will make damn sure that he stays dead. I just need to find him.

Roy's keeping an eye on Thea, Sara's staying close to Laurel. So I get you sitting outside of my house like that lacrosse player my freshman year of college.  Whoa, whoa, hey, what's going on here?

A.R.G.U.S. agents uncovered a manufacturing plant in Kahndaq. All samples were accounted for, except for one. Two weeks later, this footage was captured in a remote village in southern Qurac. One milliliter has a k*ll radius of ten miles. It only took half that amount to produce these results. Our sources have traced the sample through Europe to an estate in Markovia. So send in the army. We send in the army, we risk an international spectacle our government can't afford. This has to be off-book. If you need me to draw up the smash and grab, done. But John isn't a field agent. He's not qualified. Judging from how he and Oliver Queen spend their free time, I'd say his credits transfer. Hey, look, I don't want this thing out in the open any more than you do, but I'm not sending my boss in on another one of your business trips. I have no intention of involving the Arrow. I need you. What for? Gholem Qadir. We caught him. D.O.D. turned Qadir loose a few years ago. Who thought that was a good idea? It's a complicated world, Johnny. The nerve agent's not the only WMD Qadir's tried getting his scummy fingers on. Last month, he tried to buy Malcolm Merlyn's prototype earthquake machine. Thank you for stopping that, by the way. Fortunately, he doesn't know about your involvement in that. He remembers you as the man who tried to save his life. The nerve agent's under lock and key at his estate in Markovia. He's scheduled to host a fundraiser there shortly. The two of us haven't exactly kept in touch. We've got that covered, but our window is rapidly closing. Ok. So I infiltrate the fundraiser, come out with the package. Sounds simple enough. Nothing in this business is simple. You know that, Mr. Diggle. Follow me. I don't need you to get the nerve agent out.

Little wonky. Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm a little over-caffeinated. I just had three espressos. Speaking of coffee-- Let me stop you right there! I told myself that I would stand firm on a few points. No late night emails, no personal errands, and definitely no coffee. There'll be no espressos brought to you by me. I stand very firm on that last point. And I admire your conviction. This is Jerry Conway, your executive assistant. And I wanted to know if you'd like him to get you a coffee.

This was the next lead Sara was going to follow? Jansen's a Buddhist monk. Nine years ago, he was facing deportation to China. Merlyn bankrolled his defense.

And the world thinks you dead, Mr. Queen. The convenient thing about dead men is that no one tends to believe them. Yeah, well, what about dead men who make arrangements to get the information on that USB drive in the hands of every blogger and journalist in this hemisphere. If anything happens to Maseo's family, then you're going to spend a long time testifying in front of the senate sub-committee. The world's a much more complicated place than you realize. Edward Fyers thought he was to sh**t down that plane to destabilize the Chinese economy. In truth, I wanted to take out a single target.

Give her the connection that she craves-- honesty, sincerity... If you lie to her, she'll know. Thank you. If you'll permit a professional observation... you could use a little therapy yourself. What gives you that impression? You mean, apart from the mask and the Robin Hood costume?"

Thea, I know it's difficult. I wasn't always a k*ller. The first time, I have never been more frightened or remorseful. Then why did you do it? Because the man I k*lled m*rder*d my wife. Hey.

He fights with swords, and he's good. I seem to remember you being pretty good with a blade yourself. Mastery of swords is more than mastery of technique.

She's a friend, and she'll listen. I swore that I would always protect her from harm, but I couldn't. For years, I believed that justice had been done. The Undertaking was for her. I truly believed I could change the Glades and prevent what happened to my family from happening to anyone else. It's all been a lie, but now I have the chance to set it right. I don't understand.

You know that Brickwell k*lled your wife. Her name was Rebecca. Since my death, maintaining my usual network of associates has become--heh-- shall we say, problematic, but the fact that you were able to locate Mr. Brickwell despite the fact that he has gone to ground demonstrates your group's capacity. You followed us. We led you right to him. And I saved your lives in the bargain. So why not continue our association? You want us to team up with you?

Brick's tax collectors giving you trouble? No. It's Malcolm, but it's probably the last thing you want to think about right now. You'd be surprised. He found out who m*rder*d his wife. He's fixated on finding the guy and k*lling him. Don't take this the wrong way, but isn't k*lling people exactly what Malcolm Merlyn does? Yes, but he also protects people. During the siege, he was the only one who made me a top priority. He saved my life. I didn't know. Despite everything Malcolm was or is, it means something that he was there when I needed him the most. Even after everything he's done, he cares about people.

You were expecting something different, Merlyn? That you'd have some measure of common sense? Yes. Really thought we'd throw in with you? After what you did to Thea, to Sara, to Oliver? To save your precious city, yes. Well, that's the thing. Once we let the ends justify the means, that's just the first step. Towards what? Becoming you.  Go back to your rich neighborhood.

I don't plan on dying. That's what you said the last time you went to go face Ra's, and how did that turn out for you? Oliver, I'm about as angry with you right now than I've been with anyone in my life, but that doesn't mean I want you going on a su1c1de mission. You're unusually quiet. Yeah. Guys, want to give us a minute? So, Thea served up Merlyn. You want to save her from regretting that decision. Yeah, I get it. But? But Oliver, I can't shake the feeling that there's something more at play here. It's Thea. Plain and simple. Are you sure? Right now, it's the only thing I am sure about.  I didn't hear you come in. Why can something so small change the way you view the entire world? What did Oliver say? Did you ask him? Oliver has other things on his mind. Like what? He's going to Nanda Parbat. Cheating death once wasn't enough for him? He's convinced he's doing the right thing. Is he? You going with him? Oliver has to do what's right by his family. I have to do what's right by mine. That why you didn't go the last time? Last time, I didn't go because Oliver wouldn't let me. And when you thought he d*ed, you blamed yourself. Then I don't want to see you put yourself through that again. I can't stop Oliver from going. Then go with him. You might have hung up the uniform, Johnnie, but you're still a soldier. Standing down while your friend goes into battle just isn't in your DNA. Just get there and back in one piece. About that. You think we could borrow the A.R.G.U.S. jet?"

To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else. I am... something else. Previously, on \"Arrow\"... I k*lled Sara. Malcolm gave me something that made me susceptible to suggestion. What happened wasn't your fault, Thea, because it wasn't your decision. Malcolm? He's going to face justice. He's gone. Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again. Welcome to Nanda Parbat. When I told you that Malcolm k*lled Sara, he wanted her dead, but I am the one who fired those arrows into her chest. I promised you your vengeance. So take it. k*ll me. But spare John Diggle's life.

Let your power come not from the strength of your att*ck but from the ground that holds your feet. All men seek guidance, a purpose. The means to live without pain. Those who journey here have given such an exchange for their fealty. You mean they have to k*ll for you? No, Mr. Queen, they have to die for me. Is all of this supposed to impress me? No. It's to inform you. Surely men have branded you a m*rder*r, a torturer. But see, I would never shame you with such bluntness. Because I see it in your eyes. The struggle you have with your dual identity. Oliver Queen and the Arrow. Neither giving you what you crave. But becoming Ra's al Ghul will? Oliver Queen is a man destined to be alone. He loves a woman he knows he cannot have. You don't know me. But I know the Arrow. \"Al Sahhim.\" You will never be anything more than a vigilante for those whose lives you save at the risk of your own.

And he molded us into warriors the likes the world had never seen. We were as brothers. What happened to him? He believed himself worthy of becoming heir to the Demon, but I was the one chosen. So you had to k*ll him. Yes. But you see, I hesitated. And with that hesitation, he found an opportunity to escape, taking with him his loyalists and water from the Lazarus pit. And he has vexed me ever since. And you. I don't follow. Damien continues the League's ways, but through his own organization filled with a hive of agents devoted to his own agenda. Last year, he tried to purchase Malcolm Merlyn's earthquake generator. He gave Gholem Qadir safe haven to Markovia. And he hired Mark Shaw to steal a secret file from A.R.G.U.S. This was all the work of one man? The list goes on. Many lives have been lost, others endangered. And all because I was slow to swing a vengeful sword. And I will not have my heir haunted by the same mistake. What is it you wish me to do? There is a rival who claims to be heir to the Demon.

I set in motion the death of your city 10 minutes ago. The Alpha Omega shall be disseminated by means of four vessels. Four instruments of death.

I suppose you aren't going to tell us about these things you've seen, Oliver. We need to focus on finding the cluster bombs. Can you activate the GPS? Eventually. But I'm pretty sure the train station's gonna be blown up by then. Fine. So we do this the old-fashioned way. So this is the old-fashioned way? Can we maybe discuss last night? It's pretty amazing, right? But how could you ever want to give up that rush? Extremely easily. It's--it's not what I'm talking about. You seemed a little out of control. This coming from the guy who used to use criminals as target practice. I'm amazed by how far you've come in 5 months, and I'm under no illusions that this isn't a violent life. I just, I want you to remember that it's restraint separating us from them. Well, you've managed to be back, what, 24 hours before giving me a lecture. Think I owe Laurel 50 bucks. I'm being serious. How long has this been going on for? Nothing is going on. Ok, I've just--just become a better fighter. A better fighter remains in control when they fight. Is everything ok? It's not ok. My brother can't seem to stay out of my business. Any luck? No. Does Thea seem a little off to you? No, she's fine. Just a little too aggressive maybe. Remember, you were the same way when you started out. Saw that you took my advice on the identity concealment. Oliver, man, what are we doing? Pretending everything's normal, that we are normal? I'm looking for a way in. I was furious to think that you trusted Malcolm Merlin more than you trust me. But then I realized that I'm not angry at you, I'm angry at myself for thinking you're someone that you clearly aren't. I don't know what that means. Oliver, after everything we've been through, man, I couldn't fathom why you didn't trust me. But then I realized you couldn't. It's not who you are. You don't trust. You don't love. You were able to fool Ra\u2019s and join the League because inside you are every bit as dark as they are. Thank you for coming. Responding to a b*mb thr*at's kind of in the SCPD job description. You know what I mean. I'm glad we're working together. It seems like you're working with a lot of people these days. What's that supposed to mean? Excuse me. Dad. Prodigal Arrow returns. Captain Lance. I thought that was you last night, some mask over your head. Felt like old times. Only trying to help. That were true, you wouldn't have come back. This town started going to crap the moment you put on that hood. You brought madness into all of our lives, and the monster you were inspired monsters. Maybe. But I'm not a monster anymore. Then what are you? Nice nap? I wasn't napping. I was drugged. Where's Waller? Back in Coast City sleeping off the scotch. Wake her up. I want to know what I'm doing here. Director Waller has asked me to thank you for agreeing to take on this mission. I didn't agree to take on any-- Sorry. We're in a bit of a clock here. Now, you're getting off this plane. You can do that with a chute on your back or a b*llet in your head. Your call. Why is Waller doing this? Guess she likes you. I didn't think Waller could like anybody. Plus, you know the terrain. What terrain? Your job is to infiltrate the area, assess the thr*at, and report back. You have AES-encrypted communication gear in your pack. Now, according to our Intel, your target may be radar capable, so you'll have to HALO in. So when you think you're about to splat, only then do you pull the sh**t. Wait, is that-- Uhh! Uh-oh. You have mopey face. Were you worried after 5 months of happiness that you weren't going to be able to make it anymore? I ran into Lance. And he gave you a hug because he missed you? Yeah, well, it's not just Lance. Thea. There is something wrong with Thea. She doesn't want my help and neither does Diggle. We should never have come back here. Let's go. Let's go home. You don't want to go home. I love our new home. And I love you. But I also love it here, and you can't honestly tell me that you don't. Yeah, no, of course I miss aspects of it. The sense of purpose, the idea of helping people. But Lance was right. About what? A few months ago he told me that all I brought back from the island was pain, misery, and darkness. Of course I knew that the moment we came back here, that darkness would be waiting for me. Well, he's wrong. Dead wrong. You didn't bring the darkness back with you from Lian Yu. But, Felicity, I'm telling you that the only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness. That is why I left. And I don't want to be that type of person anymore. Maybe you just need to be a different kind of person. And you're not doing this alone anymore. Train station was a bust. No incendiaries on the platform, on the tracks, or inside any of the trains. Yeah, but if there's no b*mb in the station, then how did they expect to blow it up? You didn't bring the darkness here. The bombs aren't at the station because they're bringing them in. On a train. When's the reopening ceremony scheduled for? 9:58, to coincide with the arrival of the first high speed train from Central City. Let's suit up. You should suit up, too. What?  Mr. Slater. Sorry. He had to get off at an earlier stop. You can't be the Arrow, he d*ed. So who are you? You're about to find out. Stop the train. No, I don't want to. Even if I did, I couldn't. I destroyed the braking system 20 miles ago. Willing to die to destroy a train station? No, that would be ridiculous. Then how are you planning on getting off the train? Oh, you don't know who I am, do you? I'm Damian Darhk. Whoo! Is that all you got? Ahh! It seems you've much in common with the Arrow. You're both dead. Oh! Thank you. We need to stop the train. Got any ideas? Yeah, blow it up. Ooh."

Someone's hacked into the emergency broadcast system. They've taken over all the networks. 6 months ago, the Arrow d*ed. But what he stood for didn't. It lived on in the heroes who took up his mantle. People who believe that this city should never descend into hopelessness. Who believe although light is full of darkness, that darkness can be the key to find light. And tonight, I am declaring my intention to stand with them, to fight for this city, to be the symbol of hope that the Arrow never was. I am the Green Arrow.  Sorry about the arm. Unnecessary subterfuge to prevent anyone from suspecting your involvement with the HIVE. What do you want? Well, I'm a little disappointed the train station isn't a smoldering pile of ash. I'm not. Mass m*rder, k*lling innocents. I didn't sign up for this. You signed up to follow my instructions, to do my will. I want to know everything about this Green Arrow, where he lives, and who he loves, and I want him off the boards by the time my associates arrive. And if I don't help you? Well, then I would be surprised. 'Cause I think I made it abundantly clear you don't have a choice. So my guilt for displacing Thea is only slightly outweighed by how amazing this place is. Thea's actually been living with Laurel for the past few months. Oh. Ra's stabbed her right over there. Oh. We can get a rug. You know, I'd hate to disappoint you, but that speech is pretty hopeful. Why would that disappoint me? Oh, you know how you said you didn't know how to be a hero without the darkness? And I know how you hate being wrong. Sorry I missed the funeral. Zoom? Yeah. There was a time I would have thought this was my fault, that I brought this darkness upon us. Now I know it's not my fault. It's my responsibility. Responsibility to do what? To end it. I'm gonna k*ll him. Is there anything I can do? I want to be left alone. Ok."

If I had, she wouldn't have gotten away from me earlier. Would be alive, enough now, for some answers. We're going to get answers. Oliver, I haven't been able to get answers for more than two years now! For more than two years... You've been doing this alone. Frack. You want me to take a look at your phone for you, Miss Smoak? I think we've reached the point in our working relationship where you can call me Felicity. Have you ever considered how ironic your name is? \"Felicity\" refers to the ability to find appropriate expression for one's thoughts, which is not exactly something you're particularly good at. Yeah, you're right, let's stick with Miss Smoak. Any luck on our playing card? Yeah, it's actually right there, Felic-- uh, Miss Smoak. Mm-hmm. Uh, except it's not a playing card at all, now, in my experience, playing cards don't contain motor proteins, proprioreceptors and a neural net. The responsible thing to do would be able to get this back to its rightful owner. Is there any way to track him down? Well, if you tell me the truth about where you got it from, that could speed along the process. I did tell you the truth. I did. Now, tracking the owner? You see this ink here, for lack of a better word? It's magnetite, which is the key component to tattoo ink. You don't say. I do. I also say that magnetite happens to guide the internal compass of birds, specifically homing pigeons. So is it possible to use the magnetite in the card to get a location on our, um, poker player? Theoretically. Though, if your hypothetical poker opponent has a deck full of these cards, he'll probably be able to find you faster. Curtis, we have to-- I'm going to make you two a deal. First one to tell me where you can find the Green Arrow... Gets to live. Green Arrow? I have a better idea-- Run! Miss Smoak, I really need to know what's going on here! Here! Does the board of directors know there's a secret elevator in the building? Since when are you such a bad ass? Since always. Ok, I have multiple questions. Ok, obviously there's a very long explanation to this. The short version is that I work with the Green Arrow, this man is trying to k*ll me-- well, us, sorry-- and I'm taking us down to the only place that we're going to be safe. The lobby? Not exactly.  My liege, something has happened. What have you done?! My father was not a trusting man. He devised a means to destroy the Pit should its powers fall into the wrong hands-- like yours. Nyssa, why would you do something like this? How can you even look at your sister and ask me that? One day, I will have my moment, and I will k*ll you. And now when I do, there will be no coming back. Take her. I warned you, Laurel. I begged you. What happened to Sara last year was on Malcolm's hands, but what's happening to her now is on yours."

Probably the same woman that's been linked to the murders of three other skels in the past few days. A blonde woman. Dad, I-- I didn't know what to make of it until tonight, and then this woman here, she suspects, speaks some kind of middle eastern language, just like Sara. Is she still at your place? I've been looking for her. Why didn't you tell me, huh?! You tell Queen? No! Because he would just see this the same way as you. Oh, yeah, and how is that, huh? How is that?! That Sara is just... a thing that needs to be stopped. This is my daughter. Then why did I find you with a g*n pointed at her head? I'm not proud of that, Laurel. But people are dying.

Gym clothes, gym bag-- do either of those suggest anything to you? Physical fitness, but then I remembered you're a tech guy. I'm also a bronze metal decathlete. Bronze medal, huh? Beijing, 2008. Beijing, as in the Olympics? Mr. Palmer's recording. Did you play it? Yes. There's something off about it. You sure it's not the fact that it's a dying declaration from your ex? I mean, that is some serious Nicholas Sparks-level stuff. Don't judge. The man can write emotion. No, not that.

The man you're looking for is Vandal Savage. An immortal. Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu. We're drawn to each other in each life, and after we die, we reincarnate. Do you know who Vandal Savage is? In every lifetime, he hunts us down. We think he's trying to locate the Staff of Horus.  Naive? To think that Horus would be appeased by... trifles. The portents of his dissatisfaction grow with each passing day. The celestial rocks used to fall once a generation; now they strike with each phase of the moon. I thought it was your job to keep Horus in a good mood... Priestess. Priestess Chay-Ara only speaks out of concern for all. Otherwise, she would remain a bit more... Polite. We have warned you time and again of the sky rocks and the thr*at they pose to the court of Ramses the Wise. Dark times are coming, my pharaoh. Prayers and trifles will not be enough to stop it. Priestess. You spoke with quite the tongue in there. Did I overact? No. I love your tongue. You ok? Yeah, I'm fine, I just have a headache. Are you sure? Usually that's a sign of your memories returning. Yeah, I'm sure. I can't remember anything yet. A bunch of superheroes in a farmhouse? I feel like I've seen that in a movie before. We need a secure location. What's wrong with S.T.A.R. Labs? Well, I mean, absolutely nothing if you forget about the revolving door you guys installed so the bad guys can come and go as they please. Remind me again what happened to your old lair, or the one before that. Well, lair number one was compromised by the police, and... I will stop helping. Savage only let Barry and I live because he felt Kendra start to emerge as Hawkgirl and went after her. He can sense her and Carter's presence. We don't need to make it easier on him by staying in the city limits. Bet you wish you were staying at your mother's place now. We need to find a way to neutralize Savage's advantage. Barry, you're late. Sorry. It turns out, it's not easy finding the ass end of nowhere. Yeah, for real. The roaming charges alone are going to bankrupt me. We're discussing how to take away Savage's newfound power. And his magic stick thing. Yeah, Staff of Horus. Well, it's protected by some kind of energy field. I couldn't lay a finger on it. Maybe if you wear mittens next time. What if we made some sort of insulated gauntlets... Oh, yeah, yeah, the magnetic shielding could disrupt the-- The staff's magnetic polarity. Well, while the geek squad works-- Heard that, honey. While they work to get the staff away from Savage, we need to know everything there is to know about him. Well, I googled reincarnated nut jobs and came up with nothing. Kendra and I would be the reincarnated nut jobs. Savage is merely immortal. Merely? Welcome to the new normal. Anyone who's been around for 4,000 years should leave a trail. I'll check with A.R.G.U.S., see if they have anything on him. Laurel and I can check police reports and stuff like that. Good. We need to find a way to utilize your new ability. My ability? It might give us an advantage. Yeah, whatever you do, don't let him train you.

There is something going on, and I am going to tell you all about it. I would just like the chance to know what I'm dealing with first. Ok. Ok. Hey! You must be going through a lot right now. Yeah. You know, we should talk. Never in the history of romance have those words ever meant anything good. I just mean we should probably talk about everything that's happened-- that's happening. You know what, I'm going to suggest something radical here and say let's not talk. Look, you've got a lot on your plate right now.

My friends seem to think you're ready to talk. But I know better. You were always one stubborn son of a bitch. Pictures of Carly and Andy Jr. A real man would have asked for them by now. You know Carly cried for months because she thought you were k*lled. Andy Jr. grew up without a father. And you let them. It wasn't me. It was HIVE. They fake our deaths so we're untraceable. Floyd Lawton sh*t me with a*mo supplied by HIVE. He didn't even know. But you destroyed your family, Andy. And you never reached out to them. Not even once. How could you do that? I get it. You didn't care then, you don't care now. Just so you know, your good friend Damien Darhk att*cked the Star City Bay this morning. Hurt a whole lot of people. And the neuro-blockers he was using on you are no longer in your system. So chemically speaking, Andy, you're no longer his bitch. I'm not anyone's bitch. And I'm not yours. What happened to you, Andy? If Damien Darhk brainwashed you, I could get it. But according to Darhk, were you running dr*gs and weapons in the Stan? I had to do what I had to do. I'm giving you a chance here, man.  Thank you for your service, your mind, and your belief in me. You will forever be part of our HIVE."

One that would allow us to do this undetected. Oh, bummer. Well, at least he lasted longer than the previous one. I guess that's something. All right, let's continue to adjust the ratio of the bloom. If you told me I'd ever get used to seeing you dressed up like that, I'd... Excellent. You've got your bondage outfit on. And no mask for you? Not my thing. If we're going after Oliver, wouldn't it make sense for you to bring along a few of your little ninja friends? I can't afford to pit the League against HIVE. Do you have Oliver's location? An abandoned industrial complex outside Pennytown. You'd think Darhk would have checked to see if he was tagged with a tracker. Well, I'm sure he did. Damien's very thorough. But Oliver had me tag him with the same particular nano technology he used on me last year. What about me? No, you'll blow your cover with Darhk. It's pretty much already blown. Can you give us the room? Happily. I have enough father/daughter drama in my life as it is. Good luck. Thank you. Remember, we're on a clock. Ok, if this is about you not trusting me anymore after working with Darhk, then-- No, it's just the opposite. You've done things, things that you'll never forgive yourself for, because you were protecting me, but I'm the one who gets to decide whether I need anyone's protection.

I wanted to come along on your awesome superhero adventure because I wanted to help people, and the old me was so angry at the world, but that anger never accomplished anything.

Yeah. It would probably be a little less strange if you'd seen your baby girl in the last 18 years. You're right. I don't suppose it helps if I say that I thought staying out of your life was the best thing for you. I was protecting you and your mother. You were protecting yourself. You were wanted by the police, and you didn't want to go to jail. That is why you stayed away. And you know why the police were after me, the type of criminal I was? Mom never went into detail.

Isn't that kind of hacktivism exactly what you did at MIT? Is it really all that different from the vigilantism you practice today? We are the same, you and I. I am pretty sure that I didn't try to k*ll 8,000 people. An empty thr*at, I swear to you. I know I have no right. I'm asking for a chance, a chance to prove to you that I'm not a bad guy and that I'm not a \"bad guy.\" What is that? A record of some of the hacks I've done throughout the years. I've selected ones that could be verified by news accounts so you know I'm telling the truth. This is very simple for me, Felicity. I want to be back in your life. I know that doing that will require earning your trust back. I hope this is a first step down that very long road. So Nyssa's holding Thea's life hostage until you k*ll Malcolm Merlyn?

She has one, maybe two days, and if we can save her by k*lling the man that k*lled my sister, then how could you even think twice about that? I'm not gonna defend Malcolm. He orchestrated your sister's m*rder, he k*lled Tommy. Nothing is ever gonna changed the fact that he is Thea's family. I don't know how much you remember of my father, but he was not a good man, he threw in with Malcolm Merlyn, and all of that being said, there is nothing that I wouldn't do to have him back. So you tell me how am I supposed to take that away from Thea? But, Oliver, what's the difference if Thea dies? It doesn't have to come to that, John. There's more than one choice here. Like what? Diplomacy. What does Nyssa want? I mean, all Nyssa really wants is control of the League, so I need to convince Merlin to give her the ring, she gives us the cure, and no one has to die. Laurel, can you convince Nyssa to go along with that? Yeah. It's easier than talking Malcolm into it. Well, let me worry about Malcolm. I don't understand. Why would you save me only to k*ll my brother? Vlad att*cked me. Vlad would never do such a thing. I was defending myself, and I did not know he was your brother. Would that have made a difference? I didn't have a choice. There is always a choice. I couldn't just let him k*ll me. I'm done with you. Taiana, I have something that Reiter wants. Where did you get that? It doesn't matter. I think that we can use this against him. I have a better idea. Hey! Hey, Tai-- Get Reiter. Tell him I want to talk to him. I have something that he wants. Let me see if I've got this right. There's a magic potion that could cure Thea's bloodlust that we've never heard of but Nyssa conveniently has. I've been holding off telling you this for years, Oliver. You're very handsome, not especially bright. Bright enough to have checked. It's called the Lotus. Tatsu Yamashiro is part of the order who guards it--or did. They gave it to Nyssa, and if we don't get her to give it to Thea now... We're gonna lose her. Even assuming such an elixir existed, even assuming Miss Yamashiro's order parted with it willingly, even assuming Nyssa Al Ghul's words could be trusted, then yes. Of course I'd do anything to save my daughter, but none of that is true, Oliver. Look. I appreciate you're trying to embrace a more optimistic viewpoint these days-- Malcolm, we're talking about your daughter. Yes, and I need to do something to save her, and you need to stop wasting my time with Nyssa Al Ghul's games."

You say that as if she didn't fire the arrows that felled your sister. You and I both know that wasn't her doing. Yes. It was Malcolm Merlyn, and the time has come for recompense. I will never forgive Merlyn for all the horrible things that he's done. He's taken people, two very special people away from me. Don't you think I want him dead? Then why are you here? Because if you want Merlyn dead, then you have to drive that sword, and if you can't or if you won't, then we'll need to negotiate a compromise. You have my attention. Oliver convinces Merlyn to give up the power, and you... And you give us the cure. I would accept those terms, but Merlyn never will. Let us worry about that. And by \"us,\" you mean my husband? Oliver's speaking with Merlyn right now, and Merlyn--he is a bastard, but there is nothing that he wouldn't do to save his daughter. I hope so because if he doesn't it won't just be Thea's life that is forfeit. What do you mean? There will be w*r, and the streets of your home will run red with the blood of our enemies, whomever they may be. How'd it go with Merlyn? Not good. Nyssa? She brought an army, but if you get her the ring, she'll play ball. We can get this done with no one getting hurt. Everything all right? No, not really. I mean, it's not great. It's just not quite at the level of \"my sister's on her deathbed\" kind of bad, so... What happened? My dad came back."

I wish there were some sort of test I could do that would prove that he is who he says he is. A test is a good idea. It's a good idea for you and for us. I've got a way to bring Merlyn to the bargaining table. I'm not usually one to be summoned by my prisoners. I heard you had something for me. Taiana, please. No. I have something you want. Let me out of this cage, and it's yours. Show me what you have. Magnificent. Do we have a deal? A deal? You misunderstood. It's mine either way. Ohh! I cannot stay here, Reiter. This man k*lled my brother. And you will continue to care for him as if he were your brother. Mr. Queen is an important piece of my endeavor on this island. You'll stay with him until he's well. If his health gets worse, you'll join him in his fate. Your left-side block is slow. Your next opponent won't have my patience or my mercy. Clearly you don't understand how this is supposed to work, my husband. You were supposed to bring the Magician with you. Well, I need something from you first-- proof that what you're offering is real. A stalling tactic. Al Sa-Her thinks me the fool or that you're one. Or maybe he doesn't trust the woman trying to take the Demon's Head ring from him. Can't imagine why. Bring me a sample of the Lotus. I recognize what you are doing. Part of me even respects it, but the leadership of the League of Assassins is in the balance here. It is naive to think this can be resolved without bloodshed. This amount is not sufficient to cure her permanently, only to provide the assurance Merlyn seeks. Thank you, Nyssa. As I said, someone is going to die. I pray it won't be your sister. Was it difficult to get her discharged from the hospital? No. I spoke to Dr. Lamb. Friend of the family. Nyssa... She hooked us up with a sample of the cure. This buys Thea some more time, and you get the proof that you need. Let's see it. What are Nyssa's terms? You hand over the ring, she gives us the rest of the elixir, and Thea lives. When can we meet? Tonight. Laurel's with her now. Hi! I got your-- Oh, no. Oh, no. You have Mr. Square Bear face. What? Mr. Square Bear. Oh, my God. You don't remember. You lost him when you were, like, 4 years old, and you had that exact-- you had that exact look on your face. Oh, baby. Is it too much to hope that you lost a plushy toy? No, but adjusting for age and inflation, might be just as bad. Huh? You want to sit? What? What's up? It's dad. Noah--he's in Star City. What? How do you know? He came to see me.  Did you talk to him? Yeah. Are you all right? Yeah. You sound like you think he'd hurt me or something. Yeah. I've just been doing some checking. Is it possible that he's not the guy we thought he was, that maybe he's better than we thought he was? No. Felicity, I would love to think that your father didn't show up with some ulterior motive in your life right now, but I've been where you are more times than I care to admit, and it always ends the same way. He tells you exactly what you want to hear, and you get sucked in, and the next thing you know, you have no job, no money, and a sweet 7-year-old daughter who needs a new pair of shoes and wants to go to Space camp.

A man with a heart as small as yours is incapable of such things. My father sacrificed himself so I could survive, so that I could right his wrong. He did it by pulling out a g*n and sh**ting himself in the head not 3 feet from me. Since that day, I have lost 4 more people that I love, that I cared so much about. It never gets easier ever. I could see it in your eyes from the moment we first met. That I was good? No. That you were lost, shattered.

Thea is dying right now because of events that he set in motion. I have never hated anyone the way that I hate him.

We're under att*ck!  Found Malcolm. Where? Right underneath us. Malcolm! The Lotus effect is wearing off. She will pass by sunrise. I would like to be by her side. This has to end. No more games. You give Nyssa the damn ring! She was 4 months old when we first met. Your housekeeper Raisa, I believe, was picking you up from our house with Thea in a stroller. I peeked my head into the bassinette, and Thea, all of 16 weeks, she stuck her tongue out at me. I always knew I was connected to her, as if on some primal level I knew I was her father. A real father wouldn't let their child die just to keep his hands on power! That is not what I am doing. What's unfolding here is larger than I, and it is bigger than my daughter. It's not just her life that hangs in the balance, Oliver. For all your dealings with the League, you still remain ignorant to what it is they do for the world. Enough about the League. You're a group of Assassins. It is a force of change silently manipulating global events for hundreds of years, and I cannot, I will not put that kind of power into Nyssa Al Ghul's hands! Let me ask you something. If Damien Darhk came to you and told you to lay down your bow, let him finish his plan for Star City, would you do it? Even if it meant saving William's life? I know everything about you, Oliver. I am Ra's Al Ghul, but back to the matter at hand. You will never sacrifice your city to save your son, and believe me when I tell you that I am only making the same choice. No. I would look for another choice, and I wouldn't stop looking until there was a third option! Malcolm, what if-- what if you could have the Lotus and keep your ring? I don't see how. Nyssa's forces are stronger than I care to admit. Not by herself. You challenge her to a trial by combat. You do realize your plan would end in her death? We're all backed into a corner, Malcolm. Nyssa made her bed. This is one of your crazier ideas, and that is a competitive field. Well, sit tight. I have a crazier one coming. In deference to good taste, we will forego the removal of shirts.

Thea, I told you. Mom is-- Ollie, I, um-- I looked her up. Right after you guys broke up, she moved to Central City. She's got a son named William who's about as old as that check is. Ok, Thea. When we were in Central City, I--I knew something was bothering you. I knew it just wasn't Vandal Savage. I mean, now it makes sense. William's your son, isn't he? Yes, he is. Why haven't you told anyone? Because Samantha said that the only way that I could see him is if I promised to not tell him or anyone else that I'm his father. God, that's-- that is brutal. Are you ok? I thought I was doing ok. I spent a lot of time convincing myself that I was--that I was trying to do the right thing, but then, you know, you brought this-- the--the thing with the check in.

It's a--it's a promise that you are keeping to the mother of your child. That doesn't make it right, Thea. Look at it from Samantha's perspective. As far as she knows, you are a rich playboy who slept with a bunch of women and got her pregnant. I'm not that person anymore. Now you're the Green Arrow. Anyone who comes into your life is automatically a target. What Samantha is asking for you to do, as hard as it may be, it is the right thing to do. I know you want to tell Felicity, and trust me, I would love to be an aunt, but you have got to do the right thing for your son here. As hard as this may be for you, Ollie, keeping William a secret is keeping him safe.  You stupid son of a bitch. Reiter's gonna k*ll everyone no matter what you do.

It's not gonna be a problem. Ok. Then why did I just get a 911 text from Thea telling me that you're pulling out of the race? Have you heard from William? Do you know where he is? I don't, but I'm doing everything I can. Oh! I knew it. I knew the second I realized he was gone, I knew that you had to have some sort of involvement in this. Oh, my God. What was I thinking letting you get into his life? Two months later, and he's missing. Samantha, I need you to tell me exactly what happened. No, Oliver.

I--I went upstairs to get him for dinner, and he was gone. Gone. No--no note, no sign of struggle. Just vanished. I called the CCPD, and they have been looking everywhere, but it's already been 48 hours, and still nothing, but then a crime scene technician pulled me aside and said that I needed to talk to you about this.

Without it, I'm just a wannabe fashion designer who lives at home with her foster dad, so up to now, everyone I've gone up against with mystical powers has had some sort of totem like mine. What if Darhk has an object that helps him with his magic? I think he does. I walked in on him once or twice in front of this cabinet thing, and inside, there's some kind of, I don't know, idol. Can you draw it for me? Yeah. I'll give it a whirl. Ok, Oliver. What if this little art project doesn't yield any results? Well-- And what if it takes too long?

If Professor Macalester's theory is correct and this map is accurate-- Then Darhk must be holed up near one of these Ley lines in order for him to get the strongest signal. I'll start cross-referencing all the locations that we've encountered Darhk. And you pulled out of the race. Why isn't this man giving me my son back? He will, and everything will be fine. You keep saying that, but it hasn't been yet. You're doing everything you possibly can. You can't b*at yourself up about it. Well, you don't know me very well, do you? Just before Christmas, Darhk took Thea, Felicity, John, held them c*ptive. We agreed that I would trade myself for them. I did, and Darhk did not live up to his end of the bargain. So you're worried that's playing itself out again now. We're gonna get William back, Oliver, but when we do, I think you should consider that... Maybe letting him go isn't such a bad thing. What do you mean? Well, I heard what you told Felicity about keeping him close. Owl ears. Uh, I never knew my real parents. I grew up in foster home, and my whole life, I wondered, \"Who am I? Where did I come from? Why didn't my real parents want me?\" A boy should know who his father is. He should, and he will but knowing what William's going through right now, I realize that I wasn't ready for the answers. Learning about my heritage, my powers, the evil my mother fled our homeland to protect me from, no child should have to carry that burden. I mean, look around you.

Best things my parents ever gave me was that freedom. That and this totem, that makes me a total badass. You don't need a totem for that. You're damn right I don't. Take care of yourself, Oliver.

You have to believe me I did it for us. You--you purposely-- you put him in danger. How-- you know what? I'm not doing this anymore. This song-and-dance where you come over to my apartment and you whisper your lies, it is over! Thea, I did it to protect us. Shut up. How could you possibly think that there was an us to protect? You know, sometimes, I lay awake at night, and I wonder what Robert would think about our relationship. He raised me, he loved me, and I threw that all away the moment I became your daughter. Yes. Yes, you did, and it was your choice. And I wish I never did. Don't you dare speak to me like that. You would be dead 10 times over if not for me. I taught you how to fight, how to be strong. I turned you from a delicate, spoiled brat into a warrior, and all I've ever gotten from you in return is your venomous spite! For a very good reason! You have no idea what you are up against. You are incapable of seeing the bigger picture, but I can, and I would rather you hate me and be alive than love me and be dead. Hi, William. I hope you're well, and I hope you're safe. There's something that I-- I want to tell you. I wanted to tell you before, but... But this is better. I'm your father biologically, that is. As far as really being your father goes, I haven't earned that yet. A father should be there for his child every day no matter what to make sure that they feel loved, that they feel safe, and a child should be able to rely on their father and go to him for-- for guidance and reassurance. I have failed to do that for you... And now I'm--I'm gonna tell you why. I'm the Green Arrow, and my life is very dangerous, which is why... We decided to keep you out of it for all these years. What happened to you in Star City, that was my fault, and I can't allow anything like that to happen ever again, and that's why I've asked your mother to move you far away and to not tell anyone where she's taking you, including me. It's also why I asked her to wait to show you this message until after your 18th birthday. I wanted to give you a real childhood. I wanted to give you that gift. Good-bye, Son. I sure hope it's not forever. How much of that did you hear? Enough."

The densest, heaviest boxes are put into the moving truck first, creating a solid foundation for the rest of the boxes and providing maximum recovery time during the most physical moments of moving. There's, um... less chance for injury, too. I hired a mover. And I would never want to step on the toes of professionals, but proper distribution of the mass and density of the boxes inside the moving truck could have cost-saving effects for the moving company in the form of improved gas mileage. OK. Great. So you're doing great with the-- It's just amazing how much progress you've made in such little time. Paul must be just a physical therapy genius. Yes, like a symphony of the talents.

They just left it behind. Why would they do that? Drop the w*apon. Maybe you should radio Reiter. Why? Now we have g*ns, too. The standard of proof for a preliminary hearing is much less severe than one for a trial. Even so, the evidence against the defendant is exceedingly thin. There is no forensic or circumstantial evidence that points to the defendant's guilt. But I found Quentin Lance's testimony to be particularly compelling. His credibility is bolstered by his status as a police captain. But the fact that he was willing to incriminate himself to see justice done makes his testimony especially believable. On the strength of it, I am denying the defense's motion to dismiss and bounding the defendant over for trial. Mr. Darhk will be held without bail or possibility of release."

It is amazing what people will tell you with a few phone calls and a kind voice. Anyway--are they dead? Are they dead? No!

Of course I am, but we put up with it. We push past it because what we do is important, ok? We have to be the beacon of hope. Nobody else is. You're the beacon of hope. I quit the team because I couldn't stand to work with Oliver, but--but now that I'm out, I look at life from a different perspective. I mean, look around you. Thea, we're in a \"Die Hard\" movie with bees. Maybe I'm meant for great things, maybe I'm not, but whatever it is, it's not this. I'm sorry. I'm not coming back. Curtis.

I--I never thought I'd say this, but I am glad that you are the Black Canary, I'm glad for all the good you're doing, and I'm glad for the good it's done you, but you got to know that taking this job, that means taking off that mask forever.

Let me see, let me see. Don't worry about it, man. We deal with this kind of stuff every week. Come on. No, no, no, no. You got to get to Iron Heights now. If Merlyn's not here, then that-- that means he's on his way there with the idol. If Darhk gets that idol, no prison will be able to hold him. Ha ha. Heh heh heh. One of these days, you're gonna tell me how you get in and out of here. A magician never reveals his secrets. So what next? You gonna make a coin appear from behind my ear? You know, you're awfully flippant for a man who's asked a great deal of me. Do you have it? Perhaps now's a good time to remind you of our terms. Yes. You and your daughter get spared from Genesis. Is that still the play? I don't think you appreciate what this cost me. Oh, come on. Stop being so high-handed. What's wrong? Mr. Merlyn, do you know what the Khushu idol is? Khushu is an old Arabic term for humbleness, suffice it to say, something I wouldn't associate with you. When the earliest h*m* magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential. It's missing a piece. The Ribalvei stone. They must have hidden it someplace else. Find it, or Genesis is not what you and your daughter have to fear. All right. You're gonna need a few stitches, but, uh, this should hold for now. I'm gonna need a whole lot more than a few stitches. Merlyn's men saw you fighting for your team. Darhk's now gonna know that I'm on your side. I'm a dead man. I mean, he's just not gonna stop with me. He's gonna come for you, he's gonna come for Lyla, Sara. Oh, God. Listen. He's not gonna come for anybody. Ok? He can't. Merlyn has the idol. Look. He's probably delivering it to him right now. No, Andy. No, he doesn't. There's a piece missing. What? We separated a piece of it and put it in another location. Only thing Merlyn's delivering is a big, ugly paperweight. Darhk will find it. He finds everything. Listen, listen. Andy, listen to me, man. He won't find anything. I hid it myself."

He took an arrow for you. He has my trust. Why doesn't he have yours? Malcolm's gonna try and get the idol to Darhk if he hasn't done it already.

So what, Oliver, just because Felicity left you, I'm supposed to believe that all men are incapable of redemption? Not all men are like you, Oliver. Some of us change, some of us grow, some of us evolve. You are stuck, man, stuck in your self-pity and your self-righteousness, and that is why Felicity left you. My brother is my business.

At the hospital, you said that you'd never forgive yourself for what happened. Andy's working with Darhk, has been the entire time. He helped him find the idol, helped him out of jail.

Class president, academic decathlete, gymnast, basically a 16-year-old badass in the making. She never even missed a day of school. Until her parents met Damien Darhk, I'm guessing. She said we left them there to die, and we did. What do you mean? All those people at Reddington. There of their own choosing, Oliver.

I'm afraid I don't understand. What else do I have to bring for her when she comes out of this, you know, Lazarus Pit thing? I would do anything for your daughter, but I destroyed the Pit months ago.

Not just a pretty face this guy. Yeah. Except Oliver's not gonna go k*ll a bunch of people just to be on the same level playing field as Darhk. All things have their opposite. Darhk draws his power from fear and death. Its opposite is light and hope, la Luz Del Alma, light of the soul. If you can channel la Luz Del Alma, you will be able to repel Darhk's magic. Then that is what I'm here to learn. I wish it were just that easy. If the darkness inside you outweighs the light, instead of repelling Darhk's magic, you will end up fueling it. You will only make him more powerful. Are you getting a signal? Nope. That's one of the benefits of being on vacation. Oh. I just wanted to call my brother. You ok? Seem to be having trouble relaxing. Yeah. No. I'm-- you're probably gonna think it's stupid. Oh, I can pretty much guarantee that I won't. It's--it's this place. It just seems too perfect. Ha! Oh.

Now you know how it feels. Wait. I thought you and Donna-- Don't worry, she's safe, but I had to come back to stand with my city, because this Oliver Queen guy gives a hell of a speech. You two were supposed to stay as backup. I already lost one brother. You two put down the Ghosts. You keep people safe. What about Darhk? Darhk's mine. What are you going to do now, Oliver? Stop the posturing. We both know that you can't do it. You spared the life of the man who k*lled your mother. And you k*lled a friend of mine. You k*lled tens of thousands of innocent people. With Slade Wilson, I had a choice. This time, I don't. It's going to take forever to clean this place up. Well, I wish you guys the best of luck with that. You going home to my mama? Uh, yeah, to pack. We're leaving town for a while. Wait, why? IAB reached out. My suspension is no longer a suspension, but, uh, it's funny, you know, because, you know, being a cop's all I ever wanted, but when I got that call, I didn't feel a thing. All I could think about was Laurel, you know? But then you got her justice, Oliver, and you got me some closure, and I am never going to forget that. Well, this is going to make me feel like I'm piling on... What do you mean? Well, I... I jumped straight out of the Lazarus Pit right into this, into--to Speedy, but, um, I've just been wondering if this is even who I really am, and then I threatened to k*ll a little girl, and I--I realized I'm my father's daughter, so I--I thought about Laurel and--and what she'd say to me if she were here. I think she'd tell me to get out... Before I lost too much of myself. I'm sorry, Ollie. Hey. Come here. You don't have to apologize to me, ever. Well, it looks like it's just the 3 of us. Team Arrow, the original gangstas. Up top. You ok? Not really. I told Lyla the truth about Andy. What'd she say? She's a soldier. She understood. But I don't, and I don't think I ever will. What are you going to do? Take some time away from this team, away from the city... To figure out where I went off track and how to get back on. John, I have never done this without you. You're the one who keeps me in line. Oliver, I don't know if you've been watching lately, but it's been the other way around, man. She begged me to do it. Agh! Listen, I know that this is not going to make a ton of sense, but all of this has to do with that. It is darkness. Taiana... She was coming to that darkness. They destroyed the plane. That was Reiter. But there's another way off the island."

Well, I am not out, Amanda. I'm still filled with darkness. This was never about expunging your darkness, Mr. Queen. That darkness will always be part of you. Then what was the point? To show you that sometimes k*lling is the only path to justice. Director Waller, what do you want to do with the artifact? Have it transported to the SLAB. Yes, ma'am. So that's it. Just going to bag and tag everything and pretend like nothing ever happened? You've seen what that idol can do, how large the world truly is. Speaking of... What am I going to do with this? Our business here is concluded, Mr. Queen. Unless it's not. As I said, justice requires k*lling. A man of your talents could be useful in hot spots across the globe, or you could just go back to playing vigilante. Neither. I have a promise to keep. I know you wouldn't approve of what I did.

A.K.A. \"Charon.\" The \"Ferryman of Hades.\" Left gold coins on the eyes of one of his victims last night. Well, well, well. I didn't fail every course that I took in college.

It's called not being in denial. You really ought to give it a try. Look. For the past 5 months, you have been frozen in amber, waiting for things to go back to the way things were. They're not. You need to move forward, especially with guys like this coming into town. Don't worry about him. He's not going to be staying very long. Just find a way for me to find him, please. Why isn't he at city hall? That is a question I keep asking myself. What are you working on? If Oliver's asking, a location for our new baddie in town. And if he's not asking? I've got an address for this guy. You mind checking him out for me? I am a happily married man, Felicity. Just see what you can find out, like if he's loco or anything. We are calling him the \"Wild Dog.\" Um, isn't that already settled? Please. No. Please. Ok. Fine. Cities are like genpop. First day in, you find the biggest guy in the yard. Put him down. Hard. Sends a message. \"Screw not with me.\" So, here we all are. Now, who's the biggest guy in the yard?

The isotope that made the cloth radioactive is very specific. It came from one of the nukes that Darhk launched on Genesis day, specifically a nuke manufactured by a company called Atomic Defensive Systems. They're likely a subsidiary of Amertek. Aw, and people say he's just a pretty face. The bottom line is the subsidiary's connection with Genesis day has made Amertek's stock prices go...  This is the spot."

Why'd you give up your vengeance to save my life? I don't know. I think it's what my father would have wanted me to do. He saved my life. On Genesis day, he... wrapped me in these rags, said they were ancient, from the time of Devarim, that they would protect me from the fire. And they did. So you see why I have to avenge him. Your father didn't give up his life so you could become a k*ller. You don't know that. My father gave up his life to save mine. He made me promise to be better than him, to save this city in a way that he never could. It's been nearly 10 years since that day. So far, I've failed. Why are you telling me this? Because I don't want to fail anymore. I can't do it alone. I need a team. Let's honor the legacies of our fathers... Together. Why, Anatoly? Why k*ll them? You rang bell. They did not. I only rang the bell because of them. I couldn't have done it alone. But using team was your idea. You use them to win. Intelligent. Bratva wants that. Bratva need that. I never would have done it if I had known it was going to cost them their lives. First part of initiation: Only person you can trust-- yourself. You seem to have reopened wound, friend. What the hell? Still think you can write with your cuffs on? I mean, it wouldn't be much, just a signature. You want to read your confession before you sign it? Screw you! Now, Sergeant, I am offering you an opportunity here. I'm not owning up to this. You did this. Yeah, but I used your g*n to sh**t Private Collins. Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain. I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that. No one will ever believe your story. I will. Good luck with your court-martial. Oh, please come in, sorry. Sit down, and I will be right with you. Ok. Thank you for coming. Um, yeah, well, I almost didn't... Because, you know, I-- I screwed up, didn't I, and people got hurt. It seems like you figured it out that, um, you know, I'm drinking again, and-- and, you know, I just-- I don't want to be any--any trouble. I'm just sorry it-- sorry it didn't work out, you know. Ok, Quentin, that's-- that's not going to work for me. What? You leaving and hitting the bottle again, ok? No, I think we can do better than that. I've been to meetings. Not a meeting. A job. How does Deputy Mayor sound? You want to--you want to hire a drunk to be your deputy mayor, huh? What, Oliver's approval ratings are not low enough? If we were hiring a drunk, that would be a very good point, but that is not what we are doing. We are hiring the former captain of the SCPD who-- who just lost his daughter and is honoring her memory by dedicating himself to the city that she loved. Ok, what do you think about that one? I think maybe the wrong Queen ran for mayor. Look, Ollie, he told me you said that you needed a reason to stay sober, so... I thought maybe this could be it. Yeah, maybe it could. You let Church almost k*ll you so that you could recruit Ragman? I was betting that his heroism would Tr*mp his vengeance. That's a big risk to take on a stranger, don't you think? Yeah.

Have you talked this out with Oliver? No. Oliver and I don't have that type of relationship anymore, and you're right, I am acting widgy because having him on the team is like having a constant reminder about what I did. So clear the air. If the past 4 years have taught you anything, it should be that keeping secrets never works out.

Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left. Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included. Just saying. Where's Private Jesseman? This is usually his delivery. Flu's been tearing through the base, sir. I drew the short straw. I don't see you on the list. Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form. You sure he didn't? It's an hour's drive back to the base. Can't you refresh your Wi-Fi or something? There you are. As you were, Private. Thank you, sir.  It's Curtis. I am so sorry, and we could really use you.

I have been able to every other time somebody asked me that question. Got it. Where? This is a little awkward, but Oliver made me promise that if we got our location on Rene I would only share it with him. That's actually not surprising at all. Lest I forget... So you can pay the ferry. Heh heh heh. Why, man? Because you pissed me off. No. Why this city? I mean, why come here? Now why are you asking me that now? Cause if I'm gonna die tonight, it'd be nice to know why. From what I heard, you were popping in Bludhaven and Hub City. Why you messing with us? Ahh. For your water access. Psss. Seriously. Through Star City's docks, I can move thousands of tons of heroin, Slam, Vertigo. I'm working on the biggest consolidation of drug enterprises anybody has ever seen.

Oh, you think I'm afraid to get my hands dirty, huh? Unh! Yeah, dig! Agh!  Hey. Are you ok? I thought Church would put up more of a fight. Probably realized he didn't have to. What do you mean? I was hurting so bad, it--it got so I couldn't even see straight. Barely even remember telling him. Telling him what? Who you are. He knows you're Oliver Queen. Should have been out there with you tonight, Oliver. Dig, you said you needed time. Don't be afraid to take it, and tonight would not have made any difference. Church didn't want to fight. He wanted to run. That's because he knows k*lling the mayor is a lot easier than k*lling the Green Arrow. What? We were all thinking it. I told Rene to stand down and recover. Evelyn and Rory are gonna watch Thea and Quentin in case Church tries to get me through them. How's Curtis doing? Says he wants to get back at it. Then let's get him on Lyla and J.J. Well, good.

I'm still dealing with the fallout from not being around when the ACU was att*cked, and there is actually a rezoning vote that needs my attention. Whoa. Wait. Doesn't a vote take a backseat to finding Church before he tells every criminal in the city who you are? I have security. I'll be fine. Have you ever-- has he ever actually said that and it turned out to be true? Do you agree with her? Well, I know I said it was a good idea to start a team, but what do we have-- a Laurel Lance wannabe, a weird rag guy, a lunatic, and Curtis? Curtis just wasn't who I pictured. Uh--ahem-- they have potential. One of them got themselves captured and gave up your name. And I'd like you to debrief him. Debrief him? Church told Rene that he's planning something, something big enough to involve 5 cities. So Church just gave up his master plan? He thought Rene was gonna be dead 5 minutes later. Church is trying to consolidate the drug trade through Star City, but he was waiting for the Green Arrow to be gone before he made his move. Ok. Well, if that's true, I think I know a way we can turn this to our advantage. I'm all ears. Oliver, I know a guy, very specific skill set. I think he can be here in 24 hours. Did you get my message? Yeah. Quentin and I can take care of ourselves. Still doesn't hurt to have a shadow. Is Councilman Kullens in there? Yes. He's waiting in your office with Susan Williams. Thank you very much, fellas. I didn't agree to an interview. Yeah? Well, she's shadowing him for some type of profile, and I already tried to get her kicked out, but he was adamant about having her in there. Any advice? Don't screw it up. Councilman Kullens. Hi. Ms. Williams, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. Really? Have you watched any of my pieces? I have, and I think you're off the mark in certain instances. Is that on the record? If you want to get an actual quote, Ms. Williams, you can go through all the proper channels. This meeting is strictly about the rezoning ordinance. Yes. Councilman, as you know, I ran on a platform of unity, but it is difficult for a city to be united when so much of the zoning within it remains exclusionary. We need to open it up, allow for more affordable housing, give the people a chance to start over and rebuild, but the second the money starts rolling in, those families get squeezed out by crony capitalists. That's not gonna happen here. Hard to believe considering your family's history. I'm sorry, councilman. I don't follow. Well, the type of rezoning you're proposing happened downtown 25 years ago, but instead of affordable housing, we got skyrises, and one of them became the offices of Queen Consolidated. Is that true, Mr. Mayor? I'll consider that a no comment. I can tell you have good intentions, but politics is the art of the real. I'm sorry. I'm not changing my vote. Ok. Maybe you should just put an arrow in him."

You put a b*ating on him. I've been thinking a lot about that decision. Particularly since you've been on the other side of that b*at-down, right? Because I screwed up again.

So he asked my uncle, my aunt, everybody to pitch in, but yet they could not pull the turnip out of the ground. And so I said, \"mama, mama, did he ever pull the turnip out of the ground?\" And she said yes, but only--only after they called everybody in the village, every man, woman, and child, every farmer, every vagabond, every animal even-- the dogs and the cats-- and finally together... They wrestled it free. Does your story have a point? Yes. That without unity one cannot accomplish anything in life. As I got older, I realized it also meant something else, that scum never amount to anything without help, that the Solntsevskaya Bratva can pull at the turnip all they want, but they will never, ever, ever set it free.

Who needs labels? So either we're dealing with Prometheus or another multiple m*rder*r. Either way, he has to be stopped. Uh, does he, though? Blondie's got a point. Two less scum bags on the street. What's the downside? The downside is that we already have one psycho loose in this city. Can't afford to have another. Who gets to decide who's a psycho and who's a vigilante?  I must confess you've become something of a fascination with me. Oliver Queen. Starling City's favorite son. Presumed dead after a maritime accident 4 years ago. What do you want from me? Answers. You tried to blow up my casino. Now my sources tell me you've become Bratva. I have many enemies, but you're quite unique. A week of questioning, a week of t*rture, and you've... told my men nothing. Just except the occasional screaming for a woman, to avenge her. What was her name? Taiana. Taiana. Galina."

No. I've been to Hell, and that makes me somebody that you do not want to screw with. Try the Papp Motel. That was impressive. It got results at least.

Take it Claybourne wasn't impressed with your Robin Hood act. No, he wasn't, so I did some more digging. Claybourne didn't just price gouge with his drug. He created the epidemic. He's connected to something called the AK Desmond Group. They are black marketeers who specialize in creating bioweapons. What do you think they've been working on? Weaponized tuberculosis. He created the marketplace, Diggle, and he didn't care who d*ed in the process. And now you're gonna k*ll him. How can you read what's in that folder and have a problem with that? Have you thought about the ramifications of your actions, of actually crossing names off a list, of being judge, jury, and executioner? Men like Claybourne buy judges, they buy juries. The law doesn't apply to them. I'm not saying that you don't do some good. So what are you saying? What I'm saying is that maybe one day your actions might have some unintended consequences. Hmm. Got your 911. 911 might have been understating things a bit. Detective Malone's been abducted. ACU thinks by Prometheus. Why do they think that? He went out to track down a lead, didn't come back, his missed his last 3 call-ins, GPS on his phone's been switched off. Do you think he's dead? I think that every cop that's crossed paths with Prometheus is. Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions. Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks. I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order. I'm talking about a sh**t to k*ll. I don't know how that will sit with the public. I do. They'll love it. You know why? Because they are sick and tired as I am of watching this psycho m*rder Star City's finest and get away with it. Our cops need to know that they can fight back. They don't have to take it easy on this guy anymore. Ok. Do it, but you pull in every cop that you can find. You tell them holiday hours are revoked."

Felicity, Billy has gone missing. Chase thinks that it's Prometheus. We alerted the police. We ordered them to sh**t Prometheus on sight.

My point is dad wouldn't be disappointed in who you've become. It's like you were saying at that Christmas party. Mom and dad would be proud.

Um, so I made some sense out of Tina's crazy m*rder board. Meet Sean Sonus. 3 years ago, he was a player in Central City's criminal underworld and the target of Tina's investigation. Interestingly, Sonus disappeared around the same time that Tina did. That's why she's been traveling across the country. She's been following him. The only thing I don't understand is why Sonus is in Hub City now.  Obiah urrse. Your belly hurts? Yeah. That's not surprising. Tobias Church. He had all the gangs in Hub City under his thumb just like he tried to do back home. I'm thinking with Church's demise, it left a power vacuum here, especially in the drug trade. What's Sonus pushing? Some drug I've never heard of before called \"Sly-Dee\"? It's pronounced \"Slide,\" like in playground because it hooks kids young and makes them move to the big stuff faster. If Boland's after this scum bag, I vote we get out of her way and let her do her thing. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I actually agree with Rene. I can't believe it either. Then there's this, the after-action report on her partner's death. Sonus' men captured her and tortured her for two weeks, so even if she didn't drop out of the police, she would have been put on indefinite leave because of psychological trauma. That's all the more reason not to leave her out there alone. Look. I didn't know this Laurel chick, but you're taking on a lot to keep this promise to her. I'm thinking this is about more than just Laurel. If Sonus is connected to Church's men, that makes him more dangerous than we thought.

That's incredible. How'd you do that? Long story. Is there something you're not telling me? I know that we are not used to getting good news, but this is what it looks like. I am gonna go leak the file on Walker. Why don't you go tell John the good news? What's going on? You tell him. Tell me what? Earlier this evening, I received the NSA's case against Walker from an anonymous source. Anonymous? On the strength of it, I went the Judge Advocate ex parte and got you released on bail. Wait. What? I filed a motion to dismiss, which is as close to a slam dunk as these things get given the cards we're holding. What does this mean? It means that you can go home and hug your wife and son. You wanted this, baited me with Yurievich. Yes. To see for yourself what I've become? To remind you. Why go to all the trouble, huh? What do you care? You don't even know me. I thought I'd proven otherwise. General Shreve, Baron Reiter, Konstantin Kovar. You keep looking for new fights when the real fight has been in front of you all along. Your father literally wrote it for you, a list of all the Yurieviches and Kovars in Starling City. He told me he left me a message. And yet you still don't return home. Why do you deny your father's wish for you? You saw the reason tonight. I am not the man that my father raised! Not anymore. You're afraid of what's happened to you, of what you've become, and you're running from it. How do you know all this? Because I've been there... And I can help you find your way back. You think yourself a monster. No. I am a monster. There is a monster inside you, yes, but it is not you. I don't see the difference. No. You need to create one. You need to give the monster an identity. It's only when the monster becomes someone else, some...thing...else that you're free to be Oliver Queen. I don't know if I'm ready. I will help you become ready."

You've proven to be a most adept student. I know a few teachers who would disagree with that assessment. Hideo Yamane--his name's in my father's notebook. For good reason. Mr. Yamane's criminal enterprise is responsible for much of the designer drug trade in Starling City. I think you'll recognize his chief product. My sister was using this, so I k*lled her dealer, but I didn't consider the supply. I left her, I left the city vulnerable. This is why I found you, Oliver, so you can correct your mistakes. Now Mr. Yamane is in town tonight, meeting with his Russian contacts. He's a careful man. He'll be heavily guarded. Am I ready? That's what we find out tonight.  Sorry.

I know. Bratva get tattoos on their chest when they make captain. What about the other thing? No. I couldn't find anything else on Queen in Russia, but I reviewed criminal activity from the period he was there, and I found something very interesting. The Russians call him luchnik, the Archer.

When you ran out on me last night, you neglected to mention that it was to go help people at a hospital. I'm forgetful that way. The sh**t in custody? D.A. Chase says that he is going to plead guilty to everything. Councilwoman Pollard, this is Rene Ramirez. He works very closely with Deputy Mayor Lance. And he's a very, very vocal proponent of g*n ownership rights. Freedom isn't free, not even the freedom to bear arms. So Mr. Ramirez and I got together and came up with this. What is this? Citywide g*n control ordinances. Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a g*n. It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves. From g*n v*olence. Ok. I'm gonna back you on this if for no other reason than the optics of fighting this after what happened are lousy. There are other reasons, too, councilwoman. But I want to be perfectly clear about something. Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually, I am going to extract a political price for this. You can count on that. Sounds like a yes. I can live with what you got here."

After everything that Star City has endured in the past several years, it would be easy to become immune or--or desensitized to the v*olence that pervades our lives. And it would be human to want to respond to that v*olence with v*olence. When I think of all the people that I have lost... I remember the choices that I was forced to make in light of those tragedies. Some choices were easy. But the important choices, the choices that were worth making, they were hard. And hard choices require bravery. Fortunately, we live in the home of the brave. And we don't run from hard choices. We rise up, and we face tomorrow together. Uh, this afternoon, councilwoman Pollard and I met with the city council to pass the Star City Firearms Freedom Act, a policy that respects our freedom... And our lives. It shows that we can do both. And now we just have to be brave enough to do it."

I moved away because there was nothing left for me there. Ms. Westfield, your son is an incredibly capable and incredibly dangerous individual. He has erased virtually all traces of his identity from the Internet, and I am-- Well, I am here simply to ask you for his name. And what happens when you find him? He needs help. He-- I want him to get that help. What you want... is to cage him up like an animal, like the animal who k*lled his father. He put an arrow in his chest. What kind of monster does that?
